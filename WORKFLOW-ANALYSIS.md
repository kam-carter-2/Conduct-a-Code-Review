# Workflow Analysis

This document explains how the GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) works for the TechFlow Solutions project.

---

### 1. What triggers this workflow to run?  
The workflow is triggered by the `on:` section of the file. In this case, it runs whenever code is **pushed to the `main` branch**. That means only changes that reach `main` will trigger validation and deployment.

---

### 2. What are the four main steps this workflow performs?  
The workflow has four core steps:
1. **Checkout code** – pulls the repository’s code so other steps can access it.  
2. **Set up environment** – configures the runtime (such as Node.js) to run validation tools.  
3. **Validation checks** – runs HTML validation and broken link checks to ensure code quality.  
4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages** – if all checks pass, the site is automatically published.

### 3. What does the "Checkout code" step do and why is it necessary?  
The checkout step uses the official GitHub action `actions/checkout@v3`.  
It downloads the repository files from GitHub into the workflow’s runner environment. This is necessary so the workflow can access the project files, run tests, and deploy them. Without this step, the runner would have no code to work with.

---

### 4. What is the purpose of the environment configuration?  
The environment configuration ensures the workflow uses the correct software version and settings. For example, it installs the right version of Node.js so the validators and deployment tools run properly. This guarantees consistency between different workflow runs and avoids “works on my machine” issues.

---

### 5. How does this automated deployment improve reliability compared to manual deployment?  
Automated deployment ensures that every change goes through the same validation and deployment pipeline. It reduces human error, guarantees tests are run consistently, and ensures only code that passes checks is deployed. This makes the process faster, repeatable, and more reliable than manually copying files or publishing by hand.

---

### 6. What would happen if you pushed code to a different branch (not main)?  
The workflow would **not run**, because it is only triggered by pushes to `main`. This prevents unfinished or experimental code in feature branches from being deployed before it has been reviewed and merged.
